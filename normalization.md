Objective: To ensure that redundancies are eliminated by implementing 3NF principles
 First Normal Form (1NF)
 Each of the table should have a single primary key and atomic values for instance, the user table should have first_name and last_name
  Second Normal Form (2NF)
  All the tables must have a primary key for every single collumn referred to as UUIDs to avoid redundancies.
 Third Normal Form (3NF)
 All attributes must meet the 2NF principles: There are no dependency pathways that follow non-direct paths in the present schema design. For instance, the details in Property table should depend only on property_id and not on each other.
